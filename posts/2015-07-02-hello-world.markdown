Hi there, my name is Alexander Weidinger, aka 'irgendwie' and aka 'scriptfish'.
This post is the beginning of my blog and what is there to say, but a friendly


```Haskell
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

###Technical aspects of this blog

As I am a fan of minimalism in design, focus on functionality and don't like to have much dependencies in my projects,
I chose the static website generator [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) from [Jasper Van der Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be/)
instead of a blogging Software like the famous [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) project.

If you don't like 'the design' of this blog, here is my favourite quote for you:

> This is a motherfucking website.  
> And it's fucking perfect.

###What is this blog about?

With this blog, I want to focus on posts about IT security.
Nonetheless it's possible that I write about other things,
which I'm currently interested in or I think are worth to write about.
